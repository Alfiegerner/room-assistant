It is capable of tracking room occupancy and your location around the house with great accuracy, plus any other sensors you may want to attach. You can pick and choose the parts you need from our flexible software to get all the data you need for writing awesome new automations - room-assistant easily integrates them with your favorite home automation suite.</p><p>Imagine it: You can turn lights and heating on only in the rooms where people are actually there. You can accurately know if someone is there even when you are just chilling on your couch, situations where a motion sensor would fail and leave you in the dark. And you can even go a step further and configure your personal thermostat preferences or turn on your favorite TV channels depending on who is in the room!</p><h2 id="how-it-works"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-works">#</a> How it works</h2><p>Room occupancy detection is based on a variety of methods that can be used independently or in tandem. Bluetooth integrations aim at detecting the devices you carry around with you (phone, smart watch). Thermopile sensor integrations will detect humans by the heat they radiate, and regular motion sensors are also supported.</p><p>Place a small Linux board like the Raspberry Pi Zero W into any room you want to track and install room-assistant on it. For example, if you want to track the bedroom, living room and kitchen you would need to setup 3 different devices that are then placed in those rooms. If you don&#39;t require the room-level features you can of course also only setup a single instance in your home.</p><h2 id="why-not"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-not">#</a> Why not...?</h2><h3 id="monitor"><a class="header-anchor" href="#monitor">#</a> monitor</h3>',8),r={href:"https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},i=(0,a.Uk)("monitor"),s=(0,a.Uk)(" is a great lightweight project for tracking if a Bluetooth device is nearby, but the room presence tracking is cumbersome to setup and requires the mobile devices to be paired with all machines running the software. room-assistant automatically creates everything for you and determines the current room on its own, without you having to pair the mobile devices to anything.
