Due to this, many things have changed although all core functionality has been kept. A fresh installation of room-assistant is recommended.</p><h4 id="installation-process"><a class="header-anchor" href="#installation-process">#</a> Installation process</h4><p>The installation process has changed and is not git-based anymore when running room-assistant directly with NodeJS. Instead, you now need to install the room-assistant binary directly with npm. See the <a href="./installation#running-with-nodejs">installation guide</a> for detailed information. You can delete the old cloned folder - but keep a copy of your old config for reference.</p><p>For Docker-based installations note that on Linux systems you should also mount the <code>/var/run/dbus</code> folder into the container now to make use of the auto-discovery features.</p><p>The Home Assistant OS addon has changed its ID from <code>room-assistant</code> to <code>room_assistant</code> to comply with the standard and therefore needs to be reinstalled as a different add-on.</p><h4 id="dependencies"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dependencies">#</a> Dependencies</h4><p>Instead of installing dependencies when starting, room-assistant now just tries to install everything right away. This makes the start much quicker and less confusing. Integration-specific dependencies are marked as optional - they may fail to install initially. Make sure you fulfill the documented requirements and then run the installation command once more to get missing dependencies.</p><h4 id="config-format"><a class="header-anchor" href="#config-format">#</a> Config format</h4><p>You can still use JSON as your config format like you did before, however YAML is now also accepted and the preferred method. The config is loaded from <code>&lt;working-dir&gt;/config</code>. For Docker you can either choose to mount config files into <code>/room-assistant/config</code> or fill the <code>NODE_CONFIG</code> environment variable with your config in JSON format. Individual environment variables for the options have been removed.</p><p>Note that the layout of the config has changed, even if the naming is similar. It is recommended that you just start a fresh configuration file and copy the previous values over while consulting the <a href="./configuration">configuration</a> and <a href="/integration">integration</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="_1-0-x-to-1-1-x"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-0-x-to-1-1-x">#</a> 1.0.x to 1.1.x</h3><p>Run <code>npm install</code> to get the latest versions of the dependencies.</p><p><strong>If you used the gpio or shell service:</strong></p><p>In room-assistant 1.1.x we integrated the MQTT auto discovery feature.
