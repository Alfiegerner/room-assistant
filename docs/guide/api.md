# API

::: warning

The API is still a work in progress and some features are missing. The existing endpoints will stay compatible within the same major version though.

:::

Each instance of room-assistant exposes an HTTP API that you can use for debugging or connecting it to different services. The API is accessible under port `6415` (cannot be changed currently).

The API is documented with an OpenAPI schema that you can retrieve under `/api-json`. For a visual representation navigate to `/api`. You can make all available API calls directly in your browser from this page.
