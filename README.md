This is the nextgen version of room-assistant - rewritten on a new framework, with much more advanced features!
It's still a beta that is heavily in development, so things may change. It's still missing some of the features of the previous versions as well.
There is no documentation yet, if you don't can't find what you're looking for in the code feel free to open an issue or message me directly.

## Getting started

```bash
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
sudo npm i --global --unsafe-perm room-assistant@2.0.0-beta.3
```

Create a config file in `<working dir>/config/local.yml` and then run the software by typing `sudo room-assistant`.
